 As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
 <div class = "Treasure"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</div> <div class = "Earth">It seemed to
  me that there was nothing more fragile on Earth. </div>In the moonlight I looked at his pale forheaad, his 
  closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
  <div class = "red1"> "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..." </div> As his lips opened slightly with 
  the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <div class = "red2">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here,
  is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ."</div>
  And I felt him to be more fragile still.<span class = "last"> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame
  that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .  </span>
